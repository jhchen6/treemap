# treemap

This is a coding practice following Mike Bostock's [Treemap](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063582) example.

(Data is also obtained there.)

After seeing d3's source code, I now know my home-made tiling method is like d3.treemapBinary.

Just being curious, why does d3.v5 decide to abandon schemeCategory20?
